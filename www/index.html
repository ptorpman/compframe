            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            
            <p>
              If you want to create a component-based piece of software,
              with components separated and interacting using interfaces, 
              <i>and</i> you don't want to pay big cash for a commercial
              framework. <i>Then</i> CompFrame might be something for you.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's face it - component based softwares rock! Why?!
              Because they are easy to implement, easy to extend and
              easy to maintain. (If they are done correctly!)
            </p>
            <p>
              However, component frameworks are developed over and over
              again. And experience and expertise is lost, sometimes
              all of it. So, I decided to take my experience and, well,
              expertise (yeah right!) and create an open-source variant.
            </p>
            <p>
              My idea with CompFrame is that it can be used, extended
              and improved over time, without the need for re-inventing
              the wheel (or paying lots of cash) every time a component
              based software is supposed to be assembled. Thus, saving
              money and giving the poor developer time to address
              what's really important (and interesting).
