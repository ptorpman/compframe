Let's face it - component based softwares rock! Why?! 
Because they are easy to implement, easy to extend and
easy to maintain.

However, component frameworks are developed over and over
again. And experience and expertise is lost, sometimes
all of it. So, I decided to take my experience and, well,
expertise (hrmmmpfff) and create an open-source variant.

My idea with CompFrame is that it can be used, extended
and improved over time, without the need for re-inventing
the wheel (or paying lots of cash) every time a component
based software is supposed to be assembled. Thus, saving
money and giving the poor developer time to address
what's really important (and interesting).

* Cfg - The new configuration handling component.
* cfi_cfg_client - The client configuration interface. 
* Configuration file parsing.


---------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3
---------------------------------------------------------------
This release brings two new components to CompFrame:

S - The Scheduler Component, that allows components to be 
    scheduled, and given time to execute. In other words - a
    virtual time divider.

C - The Command Handler, that allows for command registration
    and such.

This is the first release of CompFrame. The reason for the

regurlarly backed up ;-)

* List command for instances, classes and interfaces.
* Connect  component to other on interface (with parameters)

* create <class> <instname>
* connect <inst> <inst> IFACE <param1 param2 ...>

    library that can be used by standalone programs that wants
