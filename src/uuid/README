		Portable DCE UUID Library

ATTENTION!
----------
This is a port of Jim Doyle's DCE UUID Library to Solaris.  Also some
additions for Microsoft COM GUID support has been made.  The code may
or may not still compile under Linux.

If platform independance is an issue, the build system for these
sources should be converted to using Automake
(http://sourceware.cygnus.com/automake), Autoconf
(http://sourceware.cygnus.com/autoconf) and Libtool
(www.gnu.org/software/libtool) instead of just a Makefile.

SOME NOTES
----------

* Use the file 'Makefile.stdalone' if you want to build the UUID facility
without the rest of DCE. The default Makefile is part of a the DCE RPC
suite for Linux.

* Once you have built this, you need to steal the following files
  and install them somewhere permanent on your system:

	StandAlone/uuid.h           <= header with the C interfaces
	uuid.H                      <= header with the C++ class
	libuuid.a                   <= libraries
	libuuid.so
	uuid                        <= tool

PORTING
-------

The UUID library should be readily portable to another platform.
The only platform-dependent code that you will need to consider is
that which discovers a valid IEEE 802 MAC (ethernet) address. On
the Linux and BSD platforms, this should be fairly easy, since one can
iterate over all of the network interface descriptors on the machine
and find an interface which has an Ethernet address.

For hosts that do not a native Ethernet, or are difficult to obtain
the Ethernet address for an interface, the library can obtain the MAC
address from a well known file. 

See LINUX/get_ether_addr.c.   This functions in this file will need to
be implemented on whatever target platform you wish to port.
